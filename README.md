# USB Device Control Tool

## Overview

The USB Device Control Tool is a Python script designed to monitor and control USB devices connected to a computer, preventing unauthorized data transfers. Leveraging the `pyudev` library, this tool intelligently assesses connected devices and dynamically blocks or allows them based on customizable logic, enhancing security against potential data breaches.

## Features

- **USB Event Monitoring:** Actively monitors USB events to detect device connections and disconnections in real-time.
  
- **Dynamic Device Control:** Employs customizable logic to intelligently decide whether to block or allow connected USB devices.

- **Enhanced Security:** Takes proactive measures, such as disabling USB ports, to prevent unauthorized data transfers and enhance overall system security.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/usb-device-control-tool.git
   cd usb-device-control-tool
Install Dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the USB Device Control Tool:

bash
python usb_control_tool.py
The tool will start monitoring USB events. Press Ctrl+C to exit.

Customization
Modify the is_device_blocked method in usb_control_tool.py to customize the logic for determining if a device should be blocked.

Implement your custom logic in the block_device and unblock_device methods to control USB device access.

Legal and Ethical Considerations
Ensure that the tool complies with legal and ethical standards.

Use the tool responsibly and respect privacy and confidentiality requirements.
